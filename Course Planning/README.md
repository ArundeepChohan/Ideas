A course planning application which uses the Program listing, unofficial transcript, courses listed on https://langara.ca/programs-and-courses/courses/course-attributes.html?targetCourse=A, and the list of courses schedules to make the ideal courses to take during each semester.

The concept would be is to make a binary tree of each subject like CPSC, Math and etc for each Program. Followed up doing a deletion of courses taken by using the transcript and the prerequisites found on each. It would be a collapsing binary tree that limits courses. After that all you need is to cross check the courses you require vs the courses that are more flexible to take within the next course scheduling.

It can be improved if you create your own database of the prerequisites.

Uses: Google Api with a key.

Useful if I want to add day planning or travel time around my area.
